# File Stream

**Objective**
The purpose of this project is to validate your understanding of the fstream library in C++.

**Problem**
You are required to create a program that saves a list of names to a file and then reads the file and prints the names to the console.

**Implementation**
Follow the requirements steps below to validate your understanding of the fstream.

1. Create a file called names.txt
2. Write the following names in names.txt
```
    Khalid\n
    Fahad\n
    Abdullah\n
```
make sure to close the file after writing.
3. Open the file using iso::in mode and read the names.txt and print it to the console.
4. Close the file after reading the name.

**OUTPUT**
```
    Khalid
    Fahad
    Abdullah
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
// Import fstream lib

int main () {
    
    // Create a file called names.txt

    // Write your name in names.txt, make sure to close the file after writing.

    // Open the file using iso::in mode and read the name from the file and print it to the console.

    // Close the file after reading the name.
